# Projects
Welcome to the repository for storing notebooks related to my Master's study project! This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for various notebooks developed during the course of my Master's studies.


Throughout my Master's program, I've been working on various projects and assignments that involve data analysis, machine learning, and other related topics. This repository serves as a centralized location to store, organize, and share the notebooks I've created during my studies.
